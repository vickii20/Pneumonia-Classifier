# ü©∫ Pneumonia Detection Website üñºÔ∏è

---

Welcome to the Pneumonia Detection Website! This project is a web-based application designed to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using a deep learning model. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading images and receiving diagnostic predictions.

## üöÄ Features
- üì§ **Image Upload:** Upload chest X-ray images for analysis.
- ü§ñ **Pneumonia Detection:** Uses a trained deep learning model (TensorFlow/Keras) to classify X-rays as 'Normal' or 'Pneumonia'.
- üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and responsive design for seamless interaction.
- üîí **Secure:** Uploaded images are handled securely and not stored permanently.
